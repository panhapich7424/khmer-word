# 🚨 Quick Fix for Render Deployment Error

## The Problem
```
error Couldn't find a package.json file
yarn run v1.22.22
error Couldn't find a package.json file in "/opt/render/project/src"
```

Render is treating your static site as a Node.js project and trying to run build commands.

## ⚡ Quick Fix Steps

### Option 1: Change Service Type (Recommended)
1. **Go to Render Dashboard**: https://dashboard.render.com/
2. **Find your service**: `khmer-word-game`
3. **Go to Settings** → **Environment**
4. **Change Environment** from "Node" to **"Static Site"**
5. **Update Build Settings**:
   - **Build Command**: `echo "No build needed"` (or leave empty)
   - **Publish Directory**: `.` (root directory)
6. **Click "Save Changes"**
7. **Trigger Manual Deploy**

### Option 2: Push Fixed Files
I've created the necessary files. Push them to GitHub:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix Render deployment - add package.json and render.yaml"
git push origin main
```

Then **trigger a new deploy** in Render dashboard.

## ✅ Expected Result

After the fix, you should see:
```
==> Build successful 🎉
==> Deploying...
==> Deploy successful
```

Your game will be live at: `https://khmer-word-game.onrender.com`

## 🔍 Files Added to Fix This

1. **`package.json`** - Tells Render this is a static site
2. **Updated `render.yaml`** - Forces static site deployment
3. **Updated deployment guide** - Correct settings

## 🚀 Alternative: Try Netlify

If Render continues to have issues, Netlify is easier for static sites:

1. **Go to**: https://app.netlify.com/
2. **Drag and drop** your project folder
3. **Instant deployment** - no configuration needed

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- **Your game is a static site** - no build process needed
- **All files are client-side** - HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Firebase works client-side** - no server required
- **No Node.js needed** - pure static hosting

## 📞 Next Steps

1. **Try Option 1** (change service type) first
2. **If that fails**, try Option 2 (push new files)
3. **If still issues**, consider Netlify as backup
4. **Test Firebase** once deployed

Your game should work perfectly once Render treats it as a static site!
